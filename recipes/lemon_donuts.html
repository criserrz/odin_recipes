      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li>
        1 (12 count) package Hawaiian rolls, such as King’s® Original Hawaiian
        <br />
        Sweet Rolls, separated
      </li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>
        1 1/2 cups cheesecake filling, such as Philadelphia® Cheesecake No Bake
        <br />
        Filling
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup lemon curd</li>
      \
      <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch <br>
        baking dish or rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Brush each roll with <br>
        melted butter and place in the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cheesecake filling, lemon curd, and 1 teaspoon lemon zest in a <br>
        bowl and stir well. Add mixture to a piping bag or large resealable <br>
        plastic bag. Make a small cut in one corner of the bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a paring knife to make a small cut into the side of each roll, <br>
        creating an opening large enough to pipe the filling into without going <br>
        all the way through. Fill each roll with about 1 1/2 tablespoons filling <br>
        and return to the baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar and water to a small saucepan; bring to a simmer over <br>
        medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, without stirring, <br>
        until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes; remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment, and set a rack over the <br>
        sheet. Working very carefully, dip the top of each roll into sugar <br>
        mixture and place it right side up on the rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate remaining lemon zest over rolls. Let stand until completely cooled <br>
        and lightly hardened on top, 10 to 15 minutes. If sugar mixture becomes <br>
        too thick before all rolls are coated, return the pot to low heat and <br>
        swirl it lightly until it melts again.
      </li>
    </ol>
