    <h1>Banana Bread Brownies</h1>
    <img src="/img/Banana-Bread-Brownies" alt="Banana Bread Brownies" />
    <p>
      These banana bread brownies are chocolate brownies that taste like banana <br>
      bread, and have the chewy, fudgy texture of a brownie. As an added bonus, <br>
      you'll learn how to brûlée a banana for an extra-special finishing touch.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 very ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>12 slices banana (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar (optional, for banana brûlée)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously butter a <br>
        9x9-inch square pan. A piece of parchment paper can also be added to the <br>
        bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; <br>
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second <br>
        intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer <br>
        until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla, and mashed banana, and beat <br>
        until combined. Add chocolate, and beat until mixture is well combined <br>
        and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a spatula to mix in walnuts and chocolate chips, then use the <br>
        spatula to mix in flour just until flour disappears. Transfer batter <br>
        into the prepared pan and smooth top. Place banana slices on top, evenly <br>
        spaced in a grid pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer comes out almost clean but <br>
        with some batter on the very tip. If you want fudgier brownies, do not <br>
        overcook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let brownies cool in the pan. Cover, refrigerate until cold, about 1 <br>
        hour, and serve chilled.
      </li>
      <li>
        For optional banana brûlée: While brownies are cooling, cover each <br>
        banana slice with a half teaspoon of sugar. Use a propane kitchen torch <br>
        to melt the sugar until dark brown and bubbling. Be careful not to char <br>
        the edges of the crust around the banana too much. This banana brûlée <br>
        step can also be done before the brownies go into the oven.
