    <p>
      This dessert is pure decadence. The flourless chocolate decadence cake was
      <br />
      all the rage in the 1980s. As I vaguely remember, the decade celebrated
      <br />
      decadent overindulgence, and this dessert is that â€” and more. By modern
      <br />
      standards, this cake is ridiculously rich. In fact, some of you may find
      <br />
      it too intense, but most true chocolate lovers will be in heaven. Serve
      <br />
      with ice-cold fresh raspberry sauce.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li>18 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
      <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>5 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter and flour a <br>
        9-inch cake pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt semisweet chocolate and unsalted butter together in the top of a <br>
        double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping <br>
        down the sides with a rubber spatula, until chocolate and butter are <br>
        completely melted and combined. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl with a whisk or electric mixer <br>
        until pale and very thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Sift in flour, cayenne, and <br>
        salt; whisk to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture; stir to combine. <br>
        Pour chocolate mixture into remaining egg mixture and stir until <br>
        combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until just barely set, with a jiggle below <br>
        the surface, 14 to 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 <br>
        minutes. Wrap in aluminum foil and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 <br>
        hour.
      </li>
    </ol>
